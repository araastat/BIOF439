Much of this presentation is taken from Jenny Bryan's "Creating reproducible
examples with reprex" ([link](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/reprex-reproducible-examples-with-r))

The full documentation is available at [https://reprex.tidyverse.org/](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)

## The idea of a reproducible example

- Boil down the issue into the minimal code required to get the result
- This act can itself help solve your problem
- **reprex** takes this minimal code and formats it, along with your result (errors, or whatnot)
- Send this formatted product out for help
- This makes it easy for the recipient to run your code and help

---

## How to use **reprex**

1. First, install the package: `install.packages("reprex")` (or, already installed with **tidyverse**)
1. This gives you the `reprex()` function as well as a RStudio Add-in

#### Console

## How to use reprex

1. Copy the code you want to share, using `Ctrl/Cmd-C` or the Edit menu
1. Run `reprex()` in the console, or use the Add-in ("Render reprex...")
1. You'll see a preview in the Viewer window; the actual reprex is already copied to your computer clipboard
1. Copy it to Slack/e-mail/Github/Stackoverflow
1. For this class, choose Slack `r emo::ji('smile')`

## Why reprex?

conversations about code are more productive with:

+ code that .fatinline[actually runs]
+ code that .fatinline[I don't have to run]
+ code that .fatinline[I can easily run]

## Strategies

https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html


- Use the smallest, simplest, most built-in data possible
- Include commands on a strict "need to run" basis
- Pack it in, pack it out, and don't take liberties with other people's computers

---

## Code that .fatinline[actually runs]

code is run in a new R session

ergo, it must be self-contained!

must load all the necessary packages
must create all necessary objects

---

#### not self-contained -- forgot to to attach package

```
template <- "#{EXCLAMATION} - your reprex is ${adjective}"
praise(template)
#> Error in praise(template): could not find function "praise"
```

#### not self-contained -- forgot to define template object

```
library(praise)
praise(template)
#> Error in grepl(template_pattern, x): object 'template' not found
```

#### All the pieces in place

```
library(praise)
template <- "${EXCLAMATION} - your reprex is ${adjective}!"
praise(template)
#> [1] "WHOA - your reprex is bedazzling!"
```

This provides both the working code and the results

---

## code that .fatinline[I don't have to run]

many readers have lots of experience

they can often get the point w/o running code, especially if they can see the 
output

reveal the output produced by the code

---

## code that .fatinline[I don't have to run]

.pull-left[
#### do not copy/paste from the R console

```
> test1 <- "\"Header \nLine Two\"\nValue"
> cat(test1)
"Header 
Line Two"
Value
> readr::read_csv(test1)
# A tibble: 1 x 1
  `Header \nLine Two`
  <chr>              
1 Value              
```
Others must make fiddly edits to run

]
.pull-right[
#### do not take a screenshot of your R session

![:scale 100%](img/reprex3.png)

Others must retype everything to reproduce

]

---

## code that .fatinline[I don't have to run]

```
test1 <- "\"Header \nLine Two\"\nValue"
cat(test1)
#> "Header 
#> Line Two"
#> Value
readr::read_csv(test1)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 1
#>   `Header \nLine Two`
#>   <chr>              
#> 1 Value
```

A proper reprex can be re-run via copy/paste

---

## Formatting reprex's

You can format the output of a reprex depending on where you want to use it. 
These are specified using the `venue` argument. 

```{r reprex-1, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
tribble(~Code, ~Target,
        "reprex(venue='r')", "R or Slack",
        "reprex(venue='gh')", "Github",
        "reprex(venue='so')", 'StackOverflow',
        "reprex(venue='html')", "HTML",
        "reprex(venue='rtf')", "RTF (for Word/Powerpoint)") %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

---

#### "Making a good reprex is a lot of work!"

#### Yes, it is!

#### You're asking others to experience your pain

#### This is how you meet them halfway

#### True story: experts are afrraid to offer a solution if they can't prove to themselves that it works

#### Show us the code.
